Now a days     Many objects are lost      and found by people on a daily basis. 
Implementing an efficient lost and found system     needs  resources and money, 
as they require human efforts to classify  and relate the lost items with found 
items.      The people who report for lost items      may use different words 
to describe them       and the  person who found    it may use other words to 
describe the same item.

❖ The person who lost the object couldn’t contact the person who found,
 it makes less chances for the people to get their stuff back because 
maybe the person who found the item took that to the lost and found 
location after the lost person had gone there.




 The main objective of this project is to make an app which can make 
the lost and found system online for the students, faculties, etc 
inside any college/ school/ office premises. It makes it easy and 
efficient for the people to get their lost items back because there 
is no need for a particular person to classify and relate the lost
 items with found items.

❖ By making the system online the person who lost an item could 
directly contact the person who found the item by calling or chatting
